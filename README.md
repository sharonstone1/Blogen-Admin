# THIS IS A SIMPLE DASHBOARD PROJECT

###BLOGEN ADMIN PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to learn how to build a simple dashboard using Bootstrap 5 components such as cards and icons, along with CKEditor for text editing.

In this project, I utilized various features of Bootstrap 5 to create the dashboard application. I did not apply excessive custom CSS because Bootstrap 5 is a comprehensive CSS framework.

For non-developers, using Bootstrap can greatly simplify CSS management and aid in the learning process.

This project was inspired by the Bootstrap 4 courses on Udemy. Please note that this is just a simple test to apply what I learned in the course. For beginners in Bootstrap, this project serves as a practical exercise to enhance their understanding.
